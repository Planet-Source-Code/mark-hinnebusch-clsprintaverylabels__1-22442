This project demonstrates the use of a class for printing labels.  

The clsPrintAveryLabels class is an enhancement of a class built by 
Bernard J. Tucker (berniet@zdnetonebox.com) and proper credit must
be given to him for the basis of this work.

The clsAveryLabels class is set up to print a variety of labels, not 
just Avery labels.  To use the class, you must set a variety of properties 
and then call the PrintLabel method for each line of each label to be 
printed.  Labels are printed a page at a time and the page can be populated
in any order.

The details are commented in the class.  Use the object browser (and view the
class source code) if there are any methods or properties that you don't
understand.

The class does not handle many errors.

The example project uses an Access database of label data downloaded a
while back from the Avery web site.  You should not expect it to be 
current or complete.
